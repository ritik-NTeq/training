# React JS

## Document Object Model
- React creates single page application. It doesn't load the whole page on updation. React only updates the section of the page where change was made.
- It updates <strong>DOM (Document Object Model)</strong>. But in React, we dont update the DOM directly like in HTML.
- React uses Virtual DOM - a JS object, lightweight version of Real DOM. And updating virtual DOM is much faster than Real DOM.

## Components in React

- React JS is a <strong>component</strong> based frontend library. All parts of web app'n are divided into components. A component is nothing but a small piece of user interface.

- Every React JS is a tree of components. Component lets u split the UI into independent and reusable parts.
